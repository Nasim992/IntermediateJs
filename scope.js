// We cannot get output outside the function  

Hoisting is to use the variable to the upper level. By using var we can get access the value  anywhere in the program.
But if we use let or const then we can't get access because it is block scope. Using block scope we can access the value only inside the block.
By using hoisting we can get all the access form any where in the program.
